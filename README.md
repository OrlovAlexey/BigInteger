# Big Integer Project
The implementation of Big Integer and Rational Classes in C++. <br>
Infinite precision integer and float types! (as much as accuracy your machine can give)

#### Are supported:
  - different constuctors
  - basic operations (+,-,*,/,%)
  - their equal-versions (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
  - unary minus (-)
  - post-increment and pre-increment (++)
  - comparison operation (<, >, <=, >=, ==)
  - input and output operators (<<, >>)
